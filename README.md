Script to generate resumes and cover letters

I use the templates `resume.cls` and `cover.cls` for the styling and structure of my resumes and cover letters. You are free to do so as well! The styling is inspired by the [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) style which I used on my [site](www.theodedeken.xyz).

I also created a script to automatically generate them from `.yml` files.

## Configuration files for the generators
To optimize the process of making cover letters and resumes for potential jobs I wrote a script to generate then for me from a yml file. This way content is separated from styling and structure.

### Resume yml structure
```yml

  birthdate: your birthdate
  address: your address
  phone: your phone

    text: description of project
    leveraged: leveraged knowledge
skills:

```

### Cover letter yml structure
